        <h2 class="topic">Violence against children and teenagers</h2>
        <img src="../_media/personagem do tcm 1.svg" width="380px" class="svgperso" style="float: left; padding: 19px;">
        <h4 style="text-indent: 20px;">What are the types</h4>
        <div class="tdv">All the types of violence against children and teenagers always fit into four parameters, <b>physical violence</b>, which happens through aggression, harsh punishments and lesions, <b>physical and emotional negligence</b>, which occurs through the failure to meet basic necessities of the children or the failure to recognize their vulnerabilities, <b>psychological violence</b>, that is, any type of depreciation caused by rejection or disregard, of their efforts and threats of abandonment, and finally, there is <b>sexual violence</b>, which is child prostitution, abuse, incest, among other crimes of sexual nature.</div>
        <h4 style="text-indent: 20px;">How does it happens?</h4>
        <div class="tdv">Often times this common by members of the same family, and is common in unorganized families, especially in situations where a parent is absent, and the situation tends to become even worse in lower-class families. The majority of the reported aggressors are the parents themselves, family members, step-parents, romantic partners, or people that were personally close to the victims.</div>
        <h4 style="text-indent: 20px;">How to identify it?</h4>
        <div class="tdv">The cases of child abuse are usually reported by schools or hospitals, when school staff observes a change in the victim’s behaviour, or when health practitioners notice bruises or other injuries on the victim, which may have resulted from attacks from others or self-infliction.<br>
        <span class="par">Common behaviours when a child is suffering from any sort of violence is the constant fear of adults, anxiety, obsessive behaviour, and suspicious habits. In some cases, the victim may demonstrate a lack of energy and willpower, and become antisocial or, in some cases, become very agitated and irritated.</span><br>
        <span class="par">The best way to find out if a child is a victim is discussing your assumptions with school staff, parents, friends or try and reach out to the alleged victim.</span><br>
        <span class="par">If the child does in fact, suffer from any type of violence, the best thing to do is to report the actions to the authorities, or activating the Tutelary Council.</span></div>

        <h4 style="text-indent: 20px;">What are the consequences of violence against children and teenagers?</h4>
        <div class="tdv" data-anime="left">Beyond the obvious symptoms caused by physical injuries, these actions can also create traumas, which range from phycological issues to problems in the immune system.<br>
        <span class="par">The victim can develop sleep disorders (such as insomnia or narcolepsy), eating disorders (stress eating and weight gain, which can lead obesity, or the opposite where the victim might develop anorexia or bulimia), and digestive problems (for example, a child that was already able to control their urine is not able to do so anymore and ends up urinating on their clothes).</span></div>
        
        <h4 style="text-indent: 20px;">Violence against children by accident?</h4>
        <div class="tdv" data-anime="left">There is a whole universe of possibilities of how violence can happen, like the Syndrome of Munchausen by proxy (when a parent makes up symptoms of diseases in their children, even though they are not there), intoxication, poisoning, virtuous violence, or even worst, filicide (the murder of a child by one of, or both their parents). Among the common ones, the most frequent one is negligence.</div>
